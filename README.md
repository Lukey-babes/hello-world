figuring out GitHub

Hey, Im Luke.
Just a plasterer from Perth who is looking at turning his Hobby/Passion of gaming and creating games into a career.
I have been trying to teach myself how to program for a little under 2 years now.
Currently messing around with Unity and c#, little bit of knowledge with JSON, C, C++ and javascript aswell.
